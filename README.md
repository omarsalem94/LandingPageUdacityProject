My first project using js material that I learned from the classroom.

I used a loop to create a navbar item for each section dynamically by running it on sections and then appending it to ul.

Modified the active class properties for both section and link.

When scrolling you can see which section on screen and nav bar is active

I made several comments to explain the methods used in js file
